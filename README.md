# table
Create a table with three columns: title, users cash entries and user cash outflows.

1. The first column should contain the names of months.
2. The second column should contain the cash entries.
3. The third column should contain the cash outflows.
4. The first row should contain the header of the table.
5. The last row should have the sum of the values (tip: don't use JavaScript, just hardcoded text).
